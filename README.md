**A simple React app that contains a production-ready email
address input field component**

# This assessment was created using ReactJS + Vite and tailwind to perform a simple email input with verifier and proper tag handling from the user
## Used React Hooks in order to optimize and implement the functionalities properly
### This project was challenging as it uses multiple hooks to display the user input emails and the suggested emails from the json file
#### It is also expected to use such hooks in order to avoid the re-rendering of the data which I encountered personally during the making of the project
##### Overall the project was a challenge thus requiring multiple usage of said hooks but the output was well worth it as it gave the students a really complex view of a "simple email input"
